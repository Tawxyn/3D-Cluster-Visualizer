# 3D Cluster Visualizer

A Python-based tool for generating and visualizing 3D clusters using the K-means algorithm. This tool allows you to create 3D coordinate blobs, apply the K-means clustering algorithm, and visualize the results in an interactive 3D plot.

## Features

- Generate random 3D data points.
- Apply the K-means clustering algorithm.
- Visualize clusters in 3D.
- Save and load data from CSV files.

## Installation

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

 
```bash
pip install plotly
pip install pandas (Pandas required for px.expreess).
pip install -U scikit-learn scipy matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install ipython
```

## Credit:
The project scope increased and was inspired to add a built from scratch K-Means clustering algorithm from the YouTube channel Dataquest.
