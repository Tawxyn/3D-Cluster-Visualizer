Primary Goals
    1. Use python to generate a set of 3D coordinates (x,y,z)
    2. Ensure the points are distriubuted within a definined space / limits
    3. Parse the data into a CSV file
    4. Unparse the data from a CSV
    5. Apply K-means algo to the data to clusterize data

Visualize 3D points
    1. Create a basic 3D scatter plot using Plotly
    2. Display points with default formatting to verify generation  

Cluster points
    1. Impliment clustering algorithm 
    2. Assign each point to a cluster and calcualte cluster center

Display Cluster 
    1. Update 3D scatter plot to show points with colors based on cluster
       assignment.
    2. Add markers for cluster centers (e.g., larger or differently shaped
       points).

Make the Code Modular
    1. Divide the project into functions or modules for tasks like generating
       points, clustering, and visualization.
